## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Assessment System

#### Per-Domain Assessment
The platform offers individual domain assessments for each of the Big Five personality dimensions:
- **Openness (O)**: Imagination, Artistic Interests, Emotionality, Adventurousness, Intellect, Liberalism
- **Conscientiousness (C)**: Self-Efficacy, Orderliness, Dutifulness, Achievement-Striving, Self-Discipline, Cautiousness
- **Extraversion (E)**: Friendliness, Gregariousness, Assertiveness, Activity Level, Excitement-Seeking, Cheerfulness
- **Agreeableness (A)**: Trust, Morality, Altruism, Cooperation, Modesty, Sympathy
- **Neuroticism (N)**: Anxiety, Anger, Depression, Self-Consciousness, Immoderation, Vulnerability

#### Full Assessment Mode
A comprehensive 120-item assessment covering all domains in a single session, providing complete Big Five profiling with cross-domain analysis.

#### Three-Phase Assessment Process
Each domain assessment follows a sophisticated three-phase methodology:

**Phase 1: Initial Selection**
- Users select 3 facets that best represent their behavior in specific contexts
- System narrows selection to 1 facet through elimination rounds
- Creates initial personality profile foundation

**Phase 2: Anchor-Based Scoring**
- Users rate themselves on 1-5 scales using behavioral anchors
- Anchors are contextually relevant statements for each facet
- Provides quantitative scoring for selected facets

**Phase 3: Confirmation Questions**
- Binary Yes/No/Maybe questions to refine ambiguous scores
- Helps distinguish between high, medium, and low trait levels
- Ensures scoring accuracy and reduces measurement error

### 2. Deterministic Scoring Algorithm

#### Mathematical Foundation
The scoring system uses a sophisticated algorithm that combines:
- **Prior Scores**: Weighted combination of Phase 1 selections and eliminations
- **Anchor Scores**: Direct 1-5 ratings from Phase 2
- **Confirmation Adjustments**: Binary refinements from Phase 3

#### Bucket Classification
Scores are classified into three buckets:
- **High**: Raw score ≥ 4.00 or (≥ 3.75 with positive prior)
- **Low**: Raw score ≤ 2.00 or (≤ 2.25 with negative prior)
- **Medium**: All other scores

#### Ambiguity Resolution
The system includes sophisticated ambiguity detection and resolution:
- Identifies facets with unclear scoring patterns
- Applies confirmation questions to resolve ambiguities
- Uses deterministic tie-breaking rules for consistent results

### 3. Privacy-First Data Management

#### Local-First Architecture
- All assessment data stored in browser localStorage
- No server-side data persistence by default
- Users maintain complete control over their information

#### Cryptographic Integrity
- SHA-256 hashing for data verification
- Deterministic hash generation ensures result reproducibility
- Audit trails for transparency and trust

#### Export Capabilities
- JSON export of complete assessment data
- Hash-based result sharing and verification
- Portable data format for external analysis

### 4. AI-Enhanced Psychological Profiling

#### Intelligent Profile Generation
The platform includes an optional AI-powered psychological profiling system that:
- Analyzes assessment results to generate personalized insights
- Creates 5-line personality summaries
- Provides behavioral predictions and recommendations
- Uses Google Gemini API for natural language generation

#### Caching and Performance
- Intelligent caching system prevents redundant API calls
- Lock-based concurrency control
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

### Assessment Engine
The core assessment engine implements sophisticated psychological measurement techniques:

```typescript
// Core scoring algorithm
export function computePrior(
  p: Record<string,number>, 
  t: Record<string,number>, 
  m: Record<string,number>, 
  facets: string[]
): Record<string, number> {
  return Object.fromEntries(facets.map(f => 
    [f, 2*(p[f]||0) + 1*(t[f]||0) - 2*(m[f]||0)]
  ));
}
```

### Data Validation
Comprehensive type safety using Zod schemas:

```typescript
export const ProfileSchema = z.object({
  lines: z.array(z.string()).min(1).max(10),
  version: z.string(),
  timestamp: z.number()
});
```

### AI Integration
Secure, efficient AI service integration:

```typescript
export async function writePsychProfile(
  llmCall: (params: LLMParams) => Promise<string>
): Promise<ProfileOutput> {
  // Implementation details...
}
```
